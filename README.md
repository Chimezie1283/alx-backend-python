## Introduction

Variable annotations in Python are a way of associating Python expressions with specific variable names. They were introduced in Python 3.6 as a part of PEP 526. The expressions are evaluated at run time and have no bearing on the type of the variable. However, they can be used for type checking, IDE assistance, linters, etc.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine. You can download it from the official site: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
